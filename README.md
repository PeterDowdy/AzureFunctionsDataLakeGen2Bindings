# Webjobs.Extensions.DataLakeGen2

![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/peterdowdy/AzureFunctionsDataLakeGen2Bindings/_apis/build/status/AzureFunctionsDataLakeGen2Bindings%20Release)

## Usage

Authorization uses OAuth. ClientId, ClientSecret, TenantId required.

### Input binding

```
[DataLakeGen2Path(
  ActiveDirectoryApplicationId = "application id",
  ActiveDirectoryApplicationSecret = "application secret",
  ActiveDirectoryTenantId = "tenant id"
  Path (in the form of <filesystem>@<account>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path to file or directory>) input binding
)]
```

Input binding can be one of `Stream`, `string`, `byte[]`, `DataLakeFileClient`, `DataLakeFileClient[]`, `DataLakeDirectoryClient`. Input binding of type `DataLakeDirectoryClient` doesn't seem very useful, but I've included it for completeness.

### Output binding

```
[return: DataLakeGen2Path(
  ActiveDirectoryApplicationId = "application id",
  ActiveDirectoryApplicationSecret = "application secret",
  ActiveDirectoryTenantId = "tenant id"
  Path (in the form of <filesystem>@<account>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path to file or directory>) input binding
)]
```

Output bunding can be one of `string`, `byte[]`.
